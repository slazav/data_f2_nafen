TODO for run 6

- Flopper F-sweeps in He3 gas to see two resonances.

- Compare flopper F-sweeps measured using voltage across flopper and RF field.

- Flopper F-sweeps at different RF field, to check that RF gradient field does
  not affect flopper motion (Kapitza pendulum).
  (Variant: measure voltage across flopper at different RF field).

- Flopper F-sweeps without magnetic field, to see possible response of the
  measurement system (phase rotation by lock-in, etc.)

- "critical velocity" measurements: slow warming up, a few low excitations +
  one high enough excitation. Single- or double-lockin, good time resolution.

- check "non-hydrodynamic effects" - sweeps in the non-linear regime with different
  rates.
